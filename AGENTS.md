## Python Environment
AI agents (Codex/Claude) must run Python using `source source_me.sh && python3`
If additional PYTHONPATH paths are needed add them to source_me.sh
(Prefer using the system python, use Python 3.12 for macOS and 3.13 for debian13; venv only as a last resort.).
On this user's macOS (Homebrew Python 3.12), Python modules are installed to `/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.12/site-packages/`. Debian will likely be in `/home/vosslab/.local/lib/python3.1x/site-packages/`
