# Design decisions

<!-- VENDORED HEADER: START -->
Record each durable decision about how this code and repository are shaped, once it is settled, with
the reasoning a later reader needs. Guidance Neil Voss states belongs in
[HUMAN_GUIDANCE.md](HUMAN_GUIDANCE.md), dated history in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, open discussion in
`docs/active_plans/decisions/`. [PROPAGATED HEADER - ENTRIES BELOW ARE YOURS]

### Temporary Graphify Cargo reconciliation

**Decision.** Reconcile exact Cargo aliases with their AST package twins before
reclustering; verify the resulting IDs against Graphify's loaded graph before writing.

**Why.** Graphify 0.9.80 compares normalized candidate counts with raw JSON counts,
and its original-link export otherwise drops links still pointing to removed aliases.

**Consequence.** Preserve all link records and the active shrinkage guard. Keep the
correction in one removable function; already reconciled upstream output is a no-op.

**Owner.** `normalize_cargo_twins` in
[devel/graphify_prune_tests.py](../devel/graphify_prune_tests.py)
and [devel/graphify_map_repo.py](../devel/graphify_map_repo.py).

Write each decision as a level-three heading with these four fields. `Owner` names the
authoritative code or contract document, rather than a person.
